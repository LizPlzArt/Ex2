Ex 2 year 1 semester 1 Java

This object oriented java program implements a simple spreadsheet with the following features:
Enter different types of data into cells- numbers, text, formulas.
Simple math calculations.
Referring to other cells including using them in calculations.
Printing an error when you enter invalid data.

The sheet class holds most of the functions I personally implemented in this code, as we were given a large chunk of code to work around. Unfortunately, the instructions were unclear, confusing, misleading and non compatible with the object oriented programing model.

This project was very difficult, and it seems kind of excessive.
Nonetheless, I tried to make the best out of this.
