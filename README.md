Ex 2 year 1 semester 1 Java - Simple spreadsheet

This Java project implements a basic spreadsheet application that allows users to input and manipulate data in a tabular format. this is an excersize in object oriented programing. The following features are implemented:

    1.Data Entry: Supports numbers, text, and formulas.
    
    2.Mathematical Operations: Allows simple arithmetic calculations.
    
    3.Cell Referencing: Enables referencing other cells in formulas.
    
    4.Error Handling: Prints error messages for invalid inputs.
    
    5.File I/O: Saves and loads spreadsheet data from a text file
 
The core functionality is implemented in the Sheet class, which manages cell data, calculations, and file operations. Additional support classes handle user input, cell formatting, and error detection. The sheet class holds most of the functions I personally implemented in this code, as we were given a large chunk of code to work around. Unfortunately, the instructions were unclear, confusing, misleading and non compatible with the object oriented design.

This project was very difficult, and it seems kind of excessive.
I did my best to implement the required features while maintaining good programming practices.
This is just my honest opinion, please give me a good grade :)
